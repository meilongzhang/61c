1. Should be loading in the pointer to the array, not the address to the pointer
to the array, resolved by switching add with lw
2. offset is not correct, should be 4*offset because words are stored in 4 bytes
3. we need to store temp registers before calling function, so I'm doing that
with the stack
4. loading address dynamically needs to use lw and not la
5. s1 is already the address, so we should use add instead of lw
6. did not return to the original return address, so we should add jr ra
